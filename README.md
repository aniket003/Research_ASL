# Research_ASL
####This research aims to address the pressing need for improving communication accessibility among individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing by creating a robust system for recognizing sign language. Specifically, the focus is on American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling, with the goal of detecting and translating fingerspelled gestures into text in contemporary. The technique will use advancements in artificial intelligence processing and expert systems to generate an efficient and accurate solution capable of recognizing ASL fingerspelling with precision.
The proposed system will comprise several key components, including image preprocessing, hand segmentation, feature extraction, and gesture classification. Supervised learning techniques such as Space invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers will be explored to develop models that can capture the complex movements and shapes of ASL fingerspelling. Additionally, the integration of hand tracking algorithms will be investigated to enhance gesture detection in various environmental conditions and user poses.
